## Overview

This document was written by the development team in order to demonstrate really very poor writing that will definitely be caught by our linting tools.

## Installation Process

In order to install the software, the following steps should be performed by the user:

1. The package should be downloaded from the official website by the user
2. The files must be extracted to the directory that is preferred by the user

4. Support should be contacted if problems continue to persist

## Best Practices That Should Be Followed

- Configuration files should be kept secure at all times
- Updates should be performed regularly in order to apply security patches
- System performance should be monitored continuously
- Data should be backed up very frequently
